# Steam Player Level Percentiles

This repository contains Python code to query percentiles of player levels, to infer the total number of Steam players.

![Illustration cover][img-cover]

## Requirements

- Install the latest version of [Python 3.X][python-download-url].
- Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```bash
python main.py
```


## Assumption

Let us assume that, in order to compute the percentages, Valve:

- divides the total number of players by 100,
- then truncates it.

For instance, with `16,483,473` players at level 1, and `104,857,600` players in total,
then the percentile would be:
```
16,483,473 / 1,048,576 ~ 15.719864845275879
```

which is finally displayed as:

```
https://api.steampowered.com/IPlayerService/GetSteamLevelDistribution/v1/?player_level=1
```

```json
{
  "response": {
    "player_level_percentile": 15.719864845275879
  }
}
```

## Results

```
Least Common Multiple: 1048576
```

Following our assumption, this would mean that the total number of Steam players is
a multiple of `104,857,6XY`, where `XY` are unknown digits.
This is not super useful info.ðŸ˜…

## Truncation

> **Note**
> Interestingly, the least common multiplier is a power of 2.

$$
1048576 = 1024^2 = 2^{20}
$$

This could indicate a truncation of the numbers in binary code,
which would prevent the estimation of a total number of Steam players
of the order $2^{28} - 2^{30}$, i.e. hundreds of millions.
